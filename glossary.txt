Glossary for Remove Desktop


RDP - Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is a proprietary protocol developed by
  Microsoft, which provides a user with a graphical interface to connect to
  another computer over a network connection.  The user employs RDP client
  software for this purpose, while the other computer must run RDP server
  software.

VNC - In computing, Virtual Network Computing (VNC) is a graphical desktop
  sharing system that uses the Remote Frame Buffer protocol (RFB) to remotely
  control another computer.  It transmits the keyboard and mouse events from
  one computer to another, relaying the graphical screen updates back in the
  other direction, over a network.[1]

VPN - A virtual private network (VPN) extends a private network across a public
  network, such as the Internet.  It enables a computer to send and receive data
  across shared or public networks as if it is directly connected to the private
  network, while benefiting from the functionality, security and management
  policies of the private network.[1]  A VPN is created by establishing a virtual
  point-to-point connection through the use of dedicated connections, virtual
  tunneling protocols, or traffic encryptions.
