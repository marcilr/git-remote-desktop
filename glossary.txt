Glossary for Remove Desktop


RDP - Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is a proprietary protocol developed by
      Microsoft, which provides a user with a graphical interface to connect
      to another computer over a network connection.  The user employs RDP
      client software for this purpose, while the other computer must run RDP
      server software.

      Clients exist for most versions of Microsoft Windows (including Windows
      Mobile), Linux, Unix, OS X, iOS, Android, and other operating systems.
      RDP servers are built into Windows operating systems; an RDP server for
      Unix and OS X also exists. By default, the server listens on TCP port
      3389[1] and UDP port 3389.[2]

VNC - In computing, Virtual Network Computing (VNC) is a graphical desktop
  sharing system that uses the Remote Frame Buffer protocol (RFB) to remotely
  control another computer.  It transmits the keyboard and mouse events from
  one computer to another, relaying the graphical screen updates back in the
  other direction, over a network.[1]

VPN - A virtual private network (VPN) extends a private network across a public
  network, such as the Internet.  It enables a computer to send and receive data
  across shared or public networks as if it is directly connected to the private
  network, while benefiting from the functionality, security and management
  policies of the private network.[1]  A VPN is created by establishing a virtual
  point-to-point connection through the use of dedicated connections, virtual
  tunneling protocols, or traffic encryptions.
