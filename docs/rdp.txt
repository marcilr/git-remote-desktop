Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is a proprietary protocol developed by Microsoft,
which provides a user with a graphical interface to connect to another
computer over a network connection.  The user employs RDP client software for
this purpose, while the other computer must run RDP server software.

Clients exist for most versions of Microsoft Windows (including Windows
Mobile), Linux, Unix, OS X, iOS, Android, and other modern operating systems.
RDP servers are built into Windows operating systems; an RDP server for Unix
and OS X also exists.  By default, the server listens on TCP port 3389 and UDP
port 3389.[1]
