  Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is a proprietary protocol
  developed by Microsoft, which provides a user with a
  graphical interface to connect to another computer over
  a network connection.  The user employs RDP client
  software for this purpose, while the other computer
  must run RDP server software.
