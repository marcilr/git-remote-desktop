Error running rdesktop when ssh connected to malachite from
gci covellite workstation.

Get error message:
  Oh no!  Something has gone wrong.

  A problem has occurred and the system can't recover.
  Please log out and try again.
  
  click Log Out

However, rdesktop works on covellite and rdesktop works
on malachite when logged in at the console.


Made some google xrdp tweaks to fix this:

1. Updated ~/.xsession:

exec ck-launch-session startxfce4
  to
xfce4-session

NOTE: Save old to ~/.xsession-PRIOR-20170609

2. Updated /etc/xrdp/startwm.sh

Very long...

  to

#!/bin/sh

if [ -r /etc/default/locale ]; then
  . /etc/default/locale
  export LANG LANGUAGE
fi

startxfce4

NOTE: Save old to startwm.sh-PRIOR-20170609

--tweaking4all.com/

3. Restart xrdp:
# /etc/init.d/xrdp restart


Now really need to switch connection from gci to home to the
gci cable modem route as acs is really, really painfully slow.

Switching the home to gci to the cable modem did the trick so
I figure the alternative the same going home would do the trick.

"Just xrdp gives your RDC just what is it there, bare X server.
To see "desktop", menus, icons etc you need to have some windows
manager / desktop environment installed and started.  Please
elaborate which of them did you install."
