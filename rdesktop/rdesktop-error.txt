Error running rdesktop when ssh connected to malachite from
gci covellite workstation.

Get error message:

Oh no!  Something has gone wrong.

A problem has occurred and the system can't recover.
Please log out and try again.


However, rdesktop works on covellite and rdesktop works
on malachite when logged in at the console.

Uncertain what the cause of the error is.
