Connect from gci to home, with rdesktop, over local forward
===========================================================
1. From gci workstation connect to home malachite workstation with
local forward.

Created ~/bin/connect-machite script for this:
#!/bin/bash
# connect

# Running rdesktop through a SSH tunnel in one command

#ssh -p 60144 -L 3392:216.67.45.36:3389 -N 10.103.193.72 &
ssh -vvv -N -L 5900:localhost:3389 216.67.45.36 -p 60144 \
-i /home/marcilr/.ssh/rsa16384_sshfs_nopass
SSH_PID=$!
sleep 5 # wait for the connection to establish
rdesktop 127.0.0.1:3392
kill $SSH_PID

2. Install xRDP and XFCE packages as needed (Debian jessie 8.8 amd64):
xrdp - Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) server
xfce4 - Meta-package for the Xfce Lightweight Desktop Environment

Optional but recommended:
  # Install XFCE4 terminal (way better than xterm)
  xfce4-terminal - Xfce terminal emulator
  
  # Install icon sets
  gnome-icon-theme - GNOME Desktop icon theme
  tango-icon-theme - Tango icon theme

# aptitude update
# aptitude install xrdp
# aptitude install xfce
# aptitude install xfce-terminal
# aptitude install gnome-icon-theme   (already installed
                                       on malachite - 06/09/2017)
# aptitude install tango-icon-theme   (already installed 
                                       on malachite - 06/09/2017)

3. Configure xRDP.
Create or edit ~/.xsession:

$ echo xfce4-session >~/.xsession

  That said, my original appeared to generate much faster
  sponse in rdesktop:

$ exec "ck-launch-session startxfce4" >~/.xsession


4. Update the /etc/xrdp/startwm.sh.
The content should look like this (pay attention to the last line):

#!/bin/sh

if [ -r /etc/default/locale ]; then
  . /etc/default/locale
  export LANG LANGUAGE
fi

startxfce4

NOTE: The prior /etc/xrdp/startwm.sh follows. 
      Moved to malachite:/etc/xrdp/startwm.sh-PRIOR-20170609
#!/bin/sh

if [ -r /etc/default/locale ]; then
  . /etc/default/locale
  export LANG LANGUAGE
fi

. /etc/X11/Xsession

5. Restart xrdp:
malachite:~# /etc/init.d/xrdp restart
[ ok ] Restarting xrdp (via systemctl): xrdp.service.
malachite:~#

6. Test rdesktop connection from gci covellite workstation
(Debian jessie 8.8 amd64) to home malachite workstation 
(Debian jessie 8.8 amd64) over local forward connection:

i. Start local-forward connection from gci workstation to
malachite using ~/bin/connect-malachite script:

  $ connect-malachite &
  OpenSSH_6.7p1 Debian-5+deb8u3, OpenSSL 1.0.1t  3 May 2016
  debug1: Reading configuration data /home/marcilr/.ssh/config
  debug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh/ssh_config
  ...
  debug1: Entering interactive session.
  $

  $ ps ax | grep [c]onnect-malachite
  19720 pts/1    S      0:00 /bin/bash /home/marcilr/bin/connect-malachite
  $ 

  Looks good!

ii. Connect to malachite from covellite with ssh connection:
covellite:~$ ssh malachite
Last login: Fri Jun  9 17:54:48 2017 from 209.165.134.1
malachite:~$

iii. Start rdestop connection malachite via ssh connection:

Need to figure this out again :(

On malchite this works to launch xrdp:
  malachite:~$ rdesktop -g 1152x864 localhost:3389

However, login fails with:
  Connection Log
  connecting to sesman ip 127.0.0.1 port 3350
  sesman connect ok
  sending login info to session manager, please wait...
  xrdp_mm_process_login_response: login failed
  click OK

On malachite port 3392 does not work (the default rdp port is 3389):
  malachite:~$ rdesktop -g 1152x864 localhost:3392
  Autoselected keyboard map en-us
  ERROR: localhost: unable to connect
  malachite:~$ 

On covellite rdesktop to port 3389 does not work:
  covellite:~$ rdesktop -g 1152x864 localhost:3389
  Autoselected keyboard map en-us
  ERROR: localhost: unable to connect
  covellite:~$ 

On covellite rdesktop to port 3392 does not work:
  covellite:~$ rdesktop -g 1152x864 localhost:3392
  Autoselected keyboard map en-us
  ERROR: localhost: unable to connect
  covellite:~$
