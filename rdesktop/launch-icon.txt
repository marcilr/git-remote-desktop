=============================
o Configure gnome to just run scipts
1. Open Nautilus.

2. Open this from the menu bar:
Edit > Preferences

3. Select the 'Behavior' tab.
click Behavior tab

4. Configure to run executable files
select "Run executable text files when they are opened"

5. Close the window.
click Close

Now you can double-click your executable text file in Nautilus to be asked
whether to execute or edit your script.



o Configure default application for rdp files.

1. Applications to open various file types are done through Nautilus.  Open a
Nautilus window and navigate to a file for which you want to change the
default association.  For example, the default for text files is to use the
GEdit program, but if you prefer to associate .py (python) and .php (PHP)
files with the Komodo IDE all the time, you need to change the default.

If you right-click on a .py file, you can use the "Open with Other Application"
selection if this is a one-time association.  If not, open the Properties
selection.  In the window that pops up, select the "Open With" tab.  You should
see any number of applications listed here, with the default being GEdit (a
filled-in bullet indicates the default application to open the file with).

Click the "Add" button and scroll the list. If the application you want to use
is listed, select it.  If not, click the triangle beside the "Use a custom
command" text string and either browse for the application or enter in the
full path and filename to the application. To associate Komodo IDE to the .py
file, type in the full path to the application, such as /usr/local/bin/komodo.
Taken back to the "Open With" dialog, you will see the application listed, so
select the radio button beside the application, then click the "Close" button.

In my case I had to:

1. Open Computer on gnome desktop:
double-click home
double-click Desktop

2. Get properties for rdp file:
right-click nms-deltacontrol-1.rdp > Properties
click Open With tab
click Remotedesktop client for grdesktop under Recommendend Applications
click Set as default
click Close

3. Test - On covellite gnome desktop:
double-click nms-delcontrol-1.rdp

Yeh hah!  It launches correctly in grdesktop.

o The following procedure makes grdesktop (gtk rdesktop wrapper) selectable
via Open With... Other Application in gnome.  It is not selectable by
default.  However, still no double-click rdp files to run grdesktop.

1. Open gnome's Main Menu:
Applications > System Tools > Preferences > Main Menu

2. In Main Menu get Properties for grdesktop (named Remotedesktop Client):
Applications > Internet > Remotedesktop Client > click Properties

3. At Launcher Properties append "%U" to grdesktop command:
Command: grdesktop
click Close
click Close

4. Set grdesktop to open rdp files.
right-click nms-deltacontrol-1.rdp > Open With > Other Application...
click Show other applications

5. Under Other Applications
click Remotedesktop Client (nor Remote Desktop Viewer which is vinagre)
click Select


o Removed changes made yesterday:
covellite:~/.local/share/applications$ rm grdesktop.desktop
covellite:~/.local/share/applications$ rm defaults.list

Removed "application/x-rdp=grdesktop.desktop;" from:
  covellite:~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list

o Observed that /usr/share/applications/grdesktop.desktop already exists.
i.e. No need to install under /usr/share/gdm/greeter/applications/
Very good.

o Observed that /etc/mimetypes:487 has rdp mapping:
application/x-rdp                           rdp

o Updated System wide mime associations/extensions    <===
in /etc/gnome/defaults.list:97 with x-rdp mimetype:

application/x-rdp=grdesktop.desktop

Backup /etc/gnome/defaults.list:
covellite:/etc/gnome# cp defaults.list defaults.list-20140327-ORIG

~/.local/share/applications/grdesktop.desktop

  to 

/usr/share/gdm/greeter/applications/grdesktop.desktop  



Wed Mar 26 13:22:42 AKDT 2014
=============================
Unsucessful work on GCI covellite debian wheezy amd64 workstation
application/x-rdp mimetype to get nms-deltacontrol-a.rdp grdesktop 
file on desktop to launch rdesktop connection.  It only launches
gedit text editor at this point.

o Update gnome-defaults-list

$ cp /etc/gnome/defaults.list ~/.local/share/applications

Add entry for rdp:
application/x-rdp=grdesktop.desktop

archlinux.org/

o Add application/x-rdp mime entry to 
~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list file:

application/x-rdp=grdesktop.desktop;

archlinux.org/

o Create ~/.local/share/applications/grdesktop.desktop file.
Copied userapp-Icedove-HVUXBX.desktop to grdesktop.desktop and
updated:

[Desktop Entry]
Name=grdesktop
Encoding=UTF-8
Version=1.0
Type=Application
NoDisplay=true
Exec=/usr/bin/grdesktop %u
MimeType=application/x-rdp
Comment=grdesktop - GNOME frontend for the rdesktop client

o Verify rdp in /etc/mimetypes:

covellite:/etc$ grep rdp mime.types
...
application/x-rdp   rdp
$

Looks good - Alas, still no work.
