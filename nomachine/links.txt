NoMachine NX is a fast terminal server and desktop virtualization system based
on the X11 protocol.  NX is an order of magnitude faster than VNC or X11 and 
can run on bandwidth as narrow as 10 kBit/sec.  In addition, NX translates and
embeds the MS Windows Terminal Server and VNC protocols into X/NX, enabling 
users to compress and accelerate remote Windows and VNC sessions.  The NX 
project provides a suite of libraries and X11 proxying agents implementing 
efficient compression and optimized transport of X11, SMB, IPP, HTTP, and
arbitrary protocols like audio and video over the Internet.
