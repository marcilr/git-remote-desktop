NoMachine installation

port: 4000    (from installation message)



Thu Jan 29 08:16:39 AKST 2015
=============================
Updated malachite from nomachine 4.3.30-1 amd64 to nomachine 4.4.6_7 amd64.


Fri Dec 12 11:52:11 AKST 2014
=============================
o Could not get rsa16384_openssh private key to work.  Login with marcilr
worked fine.

o Able to access malachite from GCI Network Services, OSS covellite server.
On home malachite run Applications Menu > Internet > NoMachine Services
On work covellite run Applications > Other > NoMachine

Pretty straight forward.  Did not configure crypto key on covellite's
momachine client yet.

o Terminus (10.1.0.1) home firewall to forward TCP port 4000 to malachite
for outside nomachine access.

On:          On
Proto:       TCP
Src Address: 209.165.134.7
Ext Ports:   4000
In Address:  10.1.0.55
Description: nomachine to malachite

o On malachite updated from nomachine_4.2.16_1_amd64.deb to
nomachine_4.3.30_1_amd64.deb

On malachite from vnc NoMachine displays under:

Applications Menu
  Internet
    NoMachine
    NoMachine Service

o In gnome under Applicaions > Other now find:
NoMachine
NoMachine Service

Running NoMachine displays:
  rmarcil1-nomachine, gci\rmarcil, SE, Windows 7 NX

  Double-clicking on rmarcil1-nomachine yields:
  Ooops!
  Could not connect to the server.
  Error is 111: Connection refused

  Likely nomachine service is not running.

  On rmarcil1. ran Start Menu > All Programs > NoMachine > NoMachine Service
  This started NoMachine on rmarcil1.  Whoever, still get same error from 
  nomachine debian trying to access rmarcil1.

  rmarcil1 is running the older 4.2.26.  Don't know if this makes a difference
  or not.

  CUPS Printing Backend

  The  NoMachine Node  setup procedure could not detect your
  CUPS installation: either  CUPS  is not installed on  your
  system or it was installed in a non-standard path. CUPS is
  needed  in order to  enable  printing  support  in your NX
  system.
  Please note that you can enable  printing support for your
  NX system at any time; to do this make sure  that you have
  CUPS installed then run:

    /usr/NX/scripts/setup/nxnode --printingsetup <pathname>

  to specify the location of the CUPS root path.
