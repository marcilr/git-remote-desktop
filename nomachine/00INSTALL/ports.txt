Ports used by NoMachine


port: 4000 (for nomachine connections)


NXD
The Network Server (nxd) listens by default on port 4000.  This port must be
open between client and server.  This is mandatory to allow connections by NX
protocol.  If NX protocol is used, UDP communication for multimedia uses by
default a range of ports between 4011 and 4999.  These ports must be open
between client and server.  If they are not available, traffic will fall back
to TCP communication.
