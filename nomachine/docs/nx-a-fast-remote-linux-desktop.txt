NX - A Fast Remote Linux Desktop
Posted 30th August 2011 by Gavin Burris


Many Linux users are familiar with X11 forwarding via SSH, or VNC for remote desktop sharing.
SSH can tunnel X Windows from your remote host to the local X server display.  And VNC can
remotely share the desktop seen on the monitor or start a completely new desktop in the
background.  Similarly, NoMachine (NX) can do the same things, with the bonus of a faster
compression algorithm for a more responsive GUI.

I had avoided NX because it seemed confusing and difficult to install.  Now, NX has a free client,
node and server download, all of which is easy to install and use.  These steps work on the latest
CentOS 5 and Fedora 15.

Download the latest NX Free Edition client, node and server RPMs from
www.nomachine.com/download.php and install them on your server:

# rpm -ihv nxclient-3.5.0-7.x86_64.rpm nxnode-3.5.0-6.x86_64.rpm nxserver-3.5.0-8.x86_64.rpm

On your client system, just install the client RPM:

# rpm -ihv nxclient-3.5.0-7.x86_64.rpm

Now you may log into your server by providing your username and password.

NX provides a much more responsive remote desktop, especially over low speed and high latency
connections.  There are also many options for choosing Gnome vs KDE, or even just a single program
for your session.  Give it a try.

There is also an option for sharing your desktop with multiple other users, called shadowing in NX
terminology.  The primary user logs in and starts a new Unix session.  Then another user logs in
with a Shadow session, selecting the session of the primary user.  This is great for remote
collaboration with trusted colleagues that have an account on the same server.

Make sure to check out Getting Started with NX[1]. Also, detailed instructions and troubleshooting
for installing the repository version of NX can be found at CentOS Wiki HowTos/FreeNX[2].

UPDATE: I have found that the free NX server download from nomachine.com is more functional than
the one provided in the repositories.  In particular, shadowing was broken in the repo version.
Shadowing is the desktop session sharing feature of NX.  So, I do not recommend using yum to
install NX.  NX Free Edition seems to be limited to two users, though.
