# nomachine/   "NoMachine NX is an incredible tool for enabling remote desktop
#              access.  In fact, you will be hard-pressed to find a better
#              tool for the task.  Although the free version is limited to its
#              number of connections allowed, it is still a very useful tool
#              that can be a stepping stone to the paid version should your
#              business find a need."

# rdp/         Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is a proprietary protocol
#              developed by Microsoft, which provides a user with a graphical
#              interface to connect to another computer over a network
#              connection.  The user employs RDP client software for this
#              purpose, while the other computer must run RDP server software.

# vnc/         Virtual Network Computing (VNC) is a graphical desktop sharing
#              system that uses the Remote Frame Buffer protocol (RFB) to
#              remotely control another computer.  It transmits the keyboard
#              and mouse events from one computer to another, relaying the
#              graphical screen updates back in the other direction, over a
#              network.

# vpn/         Virtual Private Network
#              A virtual private network (VPN) is a network that uses
#              primarily public telecommunication infrastructure, such as the
#              Internet, to provide remote offices or traveling users an
#              access to a central organizational network.
