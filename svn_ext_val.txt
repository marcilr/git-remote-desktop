# nomachine/   "NoMachine NX is an incredible tool for enabling remote desktop
#              access.  In fact, you will be hard-pressed to find a better
#              tool for the task.  Although the free version is limited to its
#              number of connections allowed, it is still a very useful tool
#              that can be a stepping stone to the paid version should your
#              business find a need."
