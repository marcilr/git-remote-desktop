Remote Desktop


In computing, the term remote desktop refers to a software or operating system
feature that allows a personal computer's desktop environment to be run
remotely on one system (usually a PC, but the concept applies equally to a
server), while being displayed on a separate client device.  Remote desktop
applications have varying features.  Some allow attaching to an existing user's
session (i.e., a running desktop) and "remote controlling", either displaying
the remote control session or blanking the screen.  Taking over a desktop
remotely is a form of remote administration.

From my experience there are three means of remove desktop.  These are rdp,
vnc, and rdp.  The first rdp is generally associated windows and port 3389.
That said I remember using rdesktop to get to linux boxes working at Spectrum
Wireless with Jame Crippen in 2000.

VNC works well and is what I use for linux access from home to work and 
vice-versa from GCI Network Services, OSS Developer III position that I
started October 7, 2013.  That said VNC is a bit clunky.

VPN is what works best for windows-to-windows connections.

  Looks pretty good.  Would likely beat VNC in spades.

  "NoMachine NX is an incredible tool for enabling remote desktop access. In
  fact, you will be hard-pressed to find a better tool for the task.  Although
  the free version is limited to its number of connections allowed, it is
  still a very useful tool that can be a stepping stone to the paid version
  should your business find a need."

vnc/
  Virtual Network Computing (VNC) is a graphical desktop sharing system that
  uses the Remote Frame Buffer protocol (RFB) to remotely control another
  computer.  It transmits the keyboard and mouse events from one computer to
  another, relaying the graphical screen updates back in the other direction,
  over a network.

  A virtual private network (VPN) is a network that uses primarily public
  telecommunication infrastructure, such as the Internet, to provide remote
  offices or traveling users an access to a central organizational network.
