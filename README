Remote Desktop


In computing, the term remote desktop refers to a software or operating system
feature that allows a personal computer's desktop environment to be run
remotely on one system (usually a PC, but the concept applies equally to a
server), while being displayed on a separate client device.  Remote desktop
applications have varying features.  Some allow attaching to an existing user's
session (i.e., a running desktop) and "remote controlling", either displaying
the remote control session or blanking the screen.  Taking over a desktop
remotely is a form of remote administration.

  "NoMachine NX is an incredible tool for enabling remote desktop access. In
  fact, you will be hard-pressed to find a better tool for the task.  Although
  the free version is limited to its number of connections allowed, it is
  still a very useful tool that can be a stepping stone to the paid version
  should your business find a need."
